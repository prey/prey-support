This guide requires Prey to be installed on your devices, and that they're registered under your Prey account. It will answer three questions:

1. What should I do if my computer or mobile is lost or stolen?
2. How can Prey help me?
3. What is normal and what is not?

# 1. What should I do if my computer or mobile is lost or stolen?

Keep calm and use the first device available to access your [Prey account][prey-account]. Once there, click on the missing device and set it to **Missing** mode.

This is the most important part of the process. In most cases your computer or mobile's current location won't be enough to recover it. You'll need more data, specially if you're reporting the case to the police. The extra data can be pictures, nearby wireless networks, screenshots, and the device's hardware informartion. Those are all included in Prey reports. Reports look like this.

You can also locate your device in real time on the map by just clicking a button, the **Update Location** button on the map, when clicking a device.

It can be used to quickly locate an online computer or mobile, but it doesn't replace the Missing mode. This button can be used to confirm that you forgot your phone at home, for example, but a lost or missing device should always be set to missing to gather all possible evidence.  

# 2. How can Prey help me?

Provided that it's running properly on an online device, Prey will report a series of data that will allow you to recover a lost or stolen computer. The [best case scenario][recoveries] is that you print a few reports with useful information, handle them to your local police, and they do the rest. Having consistent location over time, pictures of whoever has your device, and its network information should always allow the authorities to recover your stolen computers or mobiles.

## But it doesn't only protects against theft

Prey is a remote management and monitoring system for all your devices. You can know in real time if they actually are where they're supposed to be, you can lock them down to prevent prying eyes to access sensitive information at work or home, you can ring an alarm whenever you don't find them instead of asking others to call you, and you can even delete information from your devices if you ever need it (except on iOS).

# 3. What is normal and what is not?

The Prey agent on your devices requires an internet connection to communicate with your Prey account, and it can't run on devices that are either turned off or offine.

## Normal behavior

- **Reports take a while to arrive for lost or stolen devices.** Thieves usually turn them off, and you need them to be online. It could take a while for them to use them, or sell them and the new "owner" to log in for the first time.
- **Pictures are terribly dark.** Pictures are taken by the computer or mobile's camera or cameras. A phone in a pocket or bag will take black pictures, and a computer in a poorly-lit room won't be able to show the thieves' faces. Just wait. The phone will come out of that pocket and the sun will rise, and you'll catch them.
- **Location is wrong**. Location is based on Wi-Fi on computers, and on Wi-Fi + GPS on mobiles. Please make sure that:
	- The computer can detect nearby Wi-Fi networks
	- The iPhone or iPad allows Prey to access your location
	- The Android device's Location settings are set to High accuracy.

## Buggy behavior

- I don't get reports and I know that the device is online.
- I don't get location at all.
- I don't get pictures and the device has one or more cameras.

We can't troubleshoot lost devices, but in case you still have them with you please  If the computer is still with you please [contact us][contact-form]. We'll assist you ASAP.
